  subject: Welcome to Hail Corporate Technologies!
  body: "You passed the entry requirements for this role as a cybersecurity analyst
    very easily, and although there wasn't much selection (as this is a small, but
    high turnover company), it was an easy choice.\n\nYour job will include dealing
    with a variety of roles including but not limited to: protecting/investigating
    threats from particular individuals, investigating suspicious files that get sent
    to me, or whatever tech related job I have in mind to throw at you. \n\nI'm sure
    that you're aware by now that I rely on you to protect this company, as I am not
    well versed in this particular field. \n\nI had our previous IT guy set up this
    account for you to use. All your progress is tracked, and your findings get automatically
    sent to me.\n\n-J\n"
