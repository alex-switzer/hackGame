  body: "Greetings. I recently received an angry email from amanda complaining about
    her account getting hacked. \n\nIll cut straight to the point. The hack was linked
    to your account.\n\nI can see your inbox, and noticed that you received an email
    from what appears to be me at first glance, but upon further inspection you should
    of noticed that the email was incorrect, and so it was an IMPERSONATOR!\n\nI am
    not very happy that you did not notice, and then decided to go through with something
    so illegal! \n\nI am sorry but I can no longer say that you are an employee of
    mine, as this is too much of an offence to overlook.\n\n-J"
