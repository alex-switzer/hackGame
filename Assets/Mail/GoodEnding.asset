  body: "I'm very pleased that you were able to identify that impersonator! I just
    discovered it myself recently. I'm glad you didn't do what he asked, that's really
    illegal and would of gotten you fired. \n\nGreat work, my confidence in your skills
    is now very high. You are just the cybersecurity professional I need. \n\nDevelopers:\n\nCongratulations!
    You have completed the game, and gotten the good ending. Was this your first time
    playing? If so, great job! \n\nLooking for more to do? Try and find the easter
    eggs if you haven't already (there are 2). You could also try out all the commands
    that weren't necessary for mission completion."
