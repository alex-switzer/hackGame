  subject: 'JOB: Investigate this IP'
  body: "Greetings.\n\nFor your first task I would like you to investigate an IP address
    (attached) that was found trying to make several unauthorised requests to our
    database, but luckily our 'firewall' blocked them (whatever that is). \n\nI believe
    that this is more than enough reason to investigate the matter.\n\nI would especially
    like to know where this person is located. \n\nSuspicious IP: 73.7.145.117\n\n-J\n"
