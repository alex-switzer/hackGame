  body: "Greetings.\n\nI'm quite surprised to see you refusing work I set out for
    you. That is not really acceptable - I expect you to do the work I assign you.\n\nBecause
    of that, your performance is not satisfactory. I regret to inform you that you
    are fired.  Please collect your things and go. \n\n-J\n\nGame Developers:\n\nOh
    no! Too bad, try again, maybe you will be a better employee next time."
