  body: "Welcome to the game. To the left is the console, where you can type in commands
    and receive output. \n\nTo start out, if you haven't already, please use the help
    command by typing 'help' (without apostrophes or brackets) and pressing enter,
    or clicking away from the console. This will give you a list of commands that
    you can use. \n\nTo find out additional information on how to use a command, the
    manual command will be of use to you. \n\nPlease note that the help and manual
    commands use square brackets like this: [help] to denote that the text inside
    the brackets are command names, and as such should not be typed in the console
    with the brackets. \n\nYou will receive information from various people, including
    missions from your employer, which is who you are working for. Your welcome email
    from him will give the details regarding that. "
